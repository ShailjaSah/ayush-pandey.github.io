Welcome to my new webpage, created using Github pages and jekyll. I hope to replace my old webpage on [wix] with this one as it is ad free and it's my own! :-) 

I created this website using [Github pages] and [jekyll], it's a powerful tool to create awesome websites. I followed the tutorial on { PERSONAL } jekyll theme, available as blog posts on [this] website. After a lot of effort in setting it all up on my linux machine, it's all set now and looking great! Next step is to merge all of my different personal webpages and blogs over the internet and maybe delete others as well.
