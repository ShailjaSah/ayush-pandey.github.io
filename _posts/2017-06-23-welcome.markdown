<! --- You’ll find this post in your `_posts` directory. Go ahead and edit it and re-build the site to see your changes. You can rebuild the site in many different ways, but the most common way is to run `jekyll serve`, which launches a web server and auto-regenerates your site when a file is updated.

To add new posts, simply add a file in the `_posts` directory that follows the convention `YYYY-MM-DD-name-of-post.ext` and includes the necessary front matter. Take a look at the source for this post to get an idea about how it works.

Jekyll also offers powerful support for code snippets:

{% highlight ruby %}
def print_hi(name)
  puts "Hi, #{name}"
end
print_hi('Tom')
#=> prints 'Hi, Tom' to STDOUT.
{% endhighlight %}

Welcome to my new webpage, created using Github pages and jekyll. I hope to replace my old webpage on [wix] with this one as it is ad free and it's my own! :) 

I created this website using Github pages and [jekyll], it's a powerful tool to create awesome websites. I followed the tutorial on { PERSONAL } jekyll theme, available as blog posts on [this] website. After a lot of effort in setting it all up on my linux machine, it's all set now and looking great! Next step is to merge all of my different personal webpages and blogs over the internet and maybe delete others as well.
