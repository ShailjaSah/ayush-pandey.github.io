## About

I graduated with a bachelors and a masters degree from the Indian Institute of Technoloy (IIT) Kharagpur, India. My Bachelor of Technology (Hons.) degree is in instrumentation engineering and Master of Technology in Control System Engineering from the Electrical Engineering department. I am looking forward eagerly to join California Institute of Technology in Fall 2017 in the PhD program.


On a higher level, I am interested in the intelligent and smart machines that will exist in the future for human commute and communication. I have worked on robotics and systems' control at IIT Kharagpur and am interested in control theoretic related research and its applications.
