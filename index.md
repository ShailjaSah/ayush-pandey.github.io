<img class="profile-picture" src="Ayush1.jpg">

I am a graduate student at California Institute of Technology, working on modeling and simulation of biomolecular circuits. 

Earlier, I graduated with a bachelors and a masters degree from the Indian Institute of Technoloy (IIT) Kharagpur, India 
in 2017. My Bachelor of Technology (Hons.) degree is in instrumentation engineering and Master of Technology in 
Control System Engineering from the Electrical Engineering department. 

On a higher level, I am interested in the intelligent and smart machines that will exist in the future for human 
commute and communication. I have worked on robotics and systems' control at IIT Kharagpur and am interested in 
control theoretic related research and its applications.

## Research Interests
