## About Me

<img class="profile-picture" src="Ayush_1.jpg">

I am a graduate student at California Institute of Technology, working on modeling of synthetic biomolecular circuits. I am working in the [Murray Lab](http://www.cds.caltech.edu/~murray/wiki/index.php?title=Main_Page). Refer to the [Projects](https://ayush-pandey.github.io/projects) and [Publications](https://ayush-pandey.github.io/publication) page for more information on my current work. 

Before joining Caltech, I graduated with a bachelors and a masters degree from the Indian Institute of Technoloy (IIT) Kharagpur, India. My Bachelor of Technology (Hons.) degree is in instrumentation engineering and Master of Technology in 
Control System Engineering from the Electrical Engineering department. 

On a higher level, I am interested in the intelligent and smart machines that will exist in the future for human 
commute and communication. I have worked on robotics, and systems' modeling & control and am interested in 
control theoretic research and its applications in the development of such machines. 

## Research Interests

* Control theory
* Robust and optimal control
* Systems and synthetic biology
* Robotics
